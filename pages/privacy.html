            <p>

                This privacy policy ("Policy") describes how the personally identifiable information ("Personal
                Information") you may provide on the <a href="../index.html">roofruler.com</a> website ("Website" or
                "Service") and any of its related products and services (collectively, "Services") is collected,
                protected and used. It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your Personal
                Information and how you can access and update this information. This Policy is a legally binding
                agreement between you ("User", "you" or "your") and this Website operator ("Operator", "we", "us" or
                "our"). By accessing and using the Website and Services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood,
                and agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. This Policy does not apply to the practices of
                companies that we do not own or control, or to individuals that we do not employ or manage. <br>
                <br>

                <h3>Automatic collection of information</h3>

                When you open the Website, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends. This
                data may include information such as your device's IP address, browser type and version, operating
                system type and version, language preferences or the webpage you were visiting before you came to the
                Website and Services, pages of the Website and Services that you visit, the time spent on those pages,
                information you search for on the Website, access times and dates, and other statistics.

                <br><br>

                Information collected automatically is used only to identify potential cases of abuse and establish
                statistical information regarding the usage and traffic of the Website and Services. This statistical
                information is not otherwise aggregated in such a way that would identify any particular user of the
                system

                <br>
                <h3>Collection of personal information</h3>
                <br>

                You can access and use the Website and Services without telling us who you are or revealing any
                information by which someone could identify you as a specific, identifiable individual. If, however, you
                wish to use some of the features on the Website, you may be asked to provide certain Personal
                Information (for example, your name and e-mail address). We receive and store any information you
                knowingly provide to us when you create an account, make a purchase, or fill any online forms on the
                Website. When required, this information may include the following:

                <br><br>
                <ul>

                    <li>Personal details such as name, country of residence, etc.</li>
                    <li>Contact information such as email address, address, etc</li>
                    <li>Account details such as user name, unique user ID, password, etc.</li>
                    <li>Payment information such as credit card details, bank details, etc.</li>
                    <li>Any other materials you willingly submit to us such as articles, images, feedback, etc.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <br><br>

                Some of the information we collect is directly from you via the Website and Services. However, we may
                also collect Personal Information about you from other sources such as public databases and our joint
                marketing partners. You can choose not to provide us with your Personal Information, but then you may
                not be able to take advantage of some of the features on the Website. Users who are uncertain about what
                information is mandatory are welcome to contact us.

                <br>
                <h3>Use and processing of collected information</h3>
                <br>
                In order to make the Website and Services available to you, or to meet a legal obligation, we need to
                collect and use certain Personal Information. If you do not provide the information that we request, we
                may not be able to provide you with the requested products or services. Any of the information we
                collect from you may be used for the following purposes:
                <br><br>

                    <li>Run and operate the Website and Services</li>

                </ul>

                <br><br>
                Processing your Personal Information depends on how you interact with the Website and Services, where
                you are located in the world and if one of the following applies: (i) you have given your consent for
                one or more specific purposes; this, however, does not apply, whenever the processing of Personal
                Information is subject to California Consumer Privacy Act or European data protection law; (ii)
                provision of information is necessary for the performance of an agreement with you and/or for any
                pre-contractual obligations thereof; (iii) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal
                obligation to which you are subject; (iv) processing is related to a task that is carried out in the
                public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in us; (v) processing is necessary for
                the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party.
                <br><br>
                Note that under some legislations we may be allowed to process information until you object to such
                processing (by opting out), without having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases
                below. In any case, we will be happy to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing,
                and in particular whether the provision of Personal Information is a statutory or contractual
                requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.
                <br><br>

                <h3>Billing and payments</h3>
                <br>
                In case of services requiring payment, we request credit card or other payment account information,
                which will be used solely for processing payments. Your purchase transaction data is stored only as long
                as is necessary to complete your purchase transaction. After that is complete, your purchase transaction
                information is deleted. Where necessary for processing future payments and subject to your prior
                consent, your financial information will be stored in encrypted form on secure servers of our reputed
                payment gateway service provider who is beholden to treating your Personal Information in accordance
                with this Policy. All direct payment gateways adhere to the latest security standards as managed by the
                PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American
                Express and Discover. Sensitive and private data exchange happens over a SSL secured communication
                channel and is encrypted and protected with digital signatures, and the Website and Services are also in
                compliance with PCI vulnerability standards in order to create as secure of an environment as possible
                for Users. Scans for malware are performed on a regular basis for additional security and protection.
                <br><br>
                <h3>Managing information</h3>
                <br>

                You are able to delete certain Personal Information we have about you. The Personal Information you can
                delete may change as the Website and Services change. When you delete Personal Information, however, we
                may maintain a copy of the unrevised Personal Information in our records for the duration necessary to
                comply with our obligations to our affiliates and partners, and for the purposes described below.
                <br>

                <h3>Disclosure of information</h3>
                <br>

                Depending on the requested Services or as necessary to complete any transaction or provide any service
                you have requested, we may share your information with your consent with our trusted third parties that
                work with us, any other affiliates and subsidiaries we rely upon to assist in the operation of the
                Website and Services available to you. We do not share Personal Information with unaffiliated third
                parties. These service providers are not authorized to use or disclose your information except as
                necessary to perform services on our behalf or comply with legal requirements. We may share your
                Personal Information for these purposes only with third parties whose privacy policies are consistent
                with ours or who agree to abide by our policies with respect to Personal Information. These third
                parties are given Personal Information they need only in order to perform their designated functions,
                and we do not authorize them to use or disclose Personal Information for their own marketing or other
                purposes.
                <br><br>
                We will disclose any Personal Information we collect, use or receive if required or permitted by law,
                such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process, and when we believe in good faith that
                disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate
                fraud, or respond to a government request.
                <br><br>
                In the event we go through a business transition, such as a merger or acquisition by another company, or
                sale of all or a portion of its assets, your user account, and Personal Information will likely be among
                the assets transferred.
                <br><br>

                <h3>Retention of information</h3>
                <br>
                We will retain and use your Personal Information for the period necessary to comply with our legal
                obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements unless a longer retention period is required
                or permitted by law. We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal
                Information after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you personally. Once
                the retention period expires, Personal Information shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to access, the
                right to erasure, the right to rectification and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after
                the expiration of the retention period.
                <br><br>
                <h3>Transfer of information</h3>
                <br>
                Depending on your location, data transfers may involve transferring and storing your information in a
                country other than your own. You are entitled to learn about the legal basis of information transfers to
                a country outside the European Union or to any international organization governed by public
                international law or set up by two or more countries, such as the UN, and about the security measures
                taken by us to safeguard your information. If any such transfer takes place, you can find out more by
                checking the relevant sections of this Policy or inquire with us using the information provided in the
                contact section.
                <br><br>

                <h3>The rights of users</h3>
                <br>

                You may exercise certain rights regarding your information processed by us. In particular, you have the
                right to do the following: <br>
                (i) you have the right to withdraw consent where you have previously given your consent to the
                processing of your information; <br>
                (ii) you have the right to object to the processing of your information if the processing is carried out
                on a legal basis other than consent; <br>
                (iii) you have the right to learn if information is being processed by us, obtain disclosure regarding
                certain aspects of the processing and obtain a copy of the information undergoing processing; <br>
                (iv) you have the right to verify the accuracy of your information and ask for it to be updated or
                corrected; <br>
                (v) you have the right, under certain circumstances, to restrict the processing of your information, in
                which case, we will not process your information for any purpose other than storing it; <br>
                (vi) you have the right, under certain circumstances, to obtain the erasure of your Personal Information
                from us; <br>
                (vii) you have the right to receive your information in a structured, commonly used and machine readable
                format and, if technically feasible, to have it transmitted to another controller without any hindrance.
                This provision is applicable provided that your information is processed by automated means and that the
                processing is based on your consent, on a contract which you are part of or on pre-contractual
                obligations thereof.

                <br><br>

                <h3>The right to object to processing</h3>
                <br>

                Where Personal Information is processed for the public interest, in the exercise of an official
                authority vested in us or for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us, you may object to
                such processing by providing a ground related to your particular situation to justify the objection. You
                must know that, however, should your Personal Information be processed for direct marketing purposes,
                you can object to that processing at any time without providing any justification. To learn, whether we
                are processing Personal Information for direct marketing purposes, you may refer to the relevant
                sections of this document.
                <br><br>

                <h3>Data protection rights under GDPR</h3>
                <br>

                If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (EEA), you have certain data protection rights and
                the Operator aims to take reasonable steps to allow you to correct, amend, delete, or limit the use of
                your Personal Information. If you wish to be informed what Personal Information we hold about you and if
                you want it to be removed from our systems, please contact us. In certain circumstances, you have the

                <h3>California privacy rights</h3>

                <br>

                In addition to the rights as explained in this Policy, California residents who provide Personal
                Information (as defined in the statute) to obtain products or services for personal, family, or
                household use are entitled to request and obtain from us, once a calendar year, information about the
                Personal Information we shared, if any, with other businesses for marketing uses. If applicable, this
                information would include the categories of Personal Information and the names and addresses of those
                businesses with which we shared such personal information for the immediately prior calendar year (e.g.,
                requests made in the current year will receive information about the prior year). To obtain this
                information please contact us.
                <br><br>

                <h3>How to exercise these rights</h3>
                <br>

                Any requests to exercise your rights can be directed to the Operator through the contact details
                provided in this document. Please note that we may ask you to verify your identity before responding to
                such requests. Your request must provide sufficient information that allows us to verify that you are
                the person you are claiming to be or that you are the authorized representative of such person. You must
                include sufficient details to allow us to properly understand the request and respond to it. We cannot
                respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information unless we first verify your identity or
                authority to make such a request and confirm that the Personal Information relates to you.

                <br><br>
                <h3>Privacy of children</h3>
                <br>

                We do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from children under the age of 18. If you are under
                the age of 18, please do not submit any Personal Information through the Website and Services. We
                encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to help enforce
                this Policy by instructing their children never to provide Personal Information through the Website and
                Services without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 18 has
                provided Personal Information to us through the Website and Services, please contact us. You must also
                be at least 16 years of age to consent to the processing of your Personal Information in your country
                (in some countries we may allow your parent or guardian to do so on your behalf).
                <br><br>

                <h3>Cookies</h3>
                <br>
                The Website and Services use "cookies" to help personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text
                file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or
                deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web
                server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. <br><br>

                We may use cookies to collect, store, and track information for statistical purposes to operate the
                Website and Services. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically
                accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. To
                learn more about cookies and how to manage them, visit <a href="#">internetcookies.org</a>

                <br><br>

                <h3>Do Not Track signals</h3>
                <br><br>

                Some browsers incorporate a Do Not Track feature that signals to websites you visit that you do not want
                to have your online activity tracked. Tracking is not the same as using or collecting information in
                connection with a website. For these purposes, tracking refers to collecting personally identifiable
                information from consumers who use or visit a website or online service as they move across different
                websites over time. The Website and Services do not track its visitors over time and across third party
                websites. However, some third party sites may keep track of your browsing activities when they serve you
                content, which enables them to tailor what they present to you.
                <br><br>

                <h3>Advertisements</h3>
                <br>

                We may display online advertisements and we may share aggregated and non-identifying information about
                our customers that we or our advertisers collect through your use of the Website and Services. We do not
                share personally identifiable information about individual customers with advertisers. In some
                instances, we may use this aggregated and non-identifying information to deliver tailored advertisements
                to the intended audience.
                <br><br>
                We may also permit certain third party companies to help us tailor advertising that we think may be of
                interest to users and to collect and use other data about user activities on the Website. These
                companies may deliver ads that might place cookies and otherwise track user behavior.
                <br><br>

                <h3>Affiliates</h3>
                <br>
                We may disclose information about you to our affiliates for the purpose of being able to offer you
                related or additional products and services. Any information relating to you that we provide to our
                affiliates will be treated by those affiliates in accordance with the terms of this Policy.

                <br><br>

                <h3>Email marketing</h3>
                <br>

                We offer electronic newsletters to which you may voluntarily subscribe at any time. We are committed to
                keeping your e-mail address confidential and will not disclose your email address to any third parties
                except as allowed in the information use and processing section or for the purposes of utilizing a third
                party provider to send such emails. We will maintain the information sent via e-mail in accordance with
                applicable laws and regulations.
                <br><br>
                In compliance with the CAN-SPAM Act, all e-mails sent from us will clearly state who the e-mail is from
                and provide clear information on how to contact the sender.
                <br><br>

                <h3>Links to other resources</h3>

                <br>

                The Website and Services contain links to other resources that are not owned or controlled by us. Please
                be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other resources or third parties.
                We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Website and Services and to read the privacy statements
                of each and every resource that may collect Personal Information.
                <br><br>

                <h3>Information security</h3>
                <br>

                We secure information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected
                from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We maintain reasonable administrative, technical, and
                physical safeguards in an effort to protect against unauthorized access, use, modification, and
                disclosure of Personal Information in its control and custody. However, no data transmission over the
                Internet or wireless network can be guaranteed. Therefore, while we strive to protect your Personal
                Information, you acknowledge that (i) there are security and privacy limitations of the Internet which
                are beyond our control; (ii) the security, integrity, and privacy of any and all information and data
                exchanged between you and the Website and Services cannot be guaranteed; and (iii) any such information
                and data may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third party, despite best efforts.
                <br><br>

                <h3>Data breach</h3>
                <br>

                In the event we become aware that the security of the Website and Services has been compromised or users
                Personal Information has been disclosed to unrelated third parties as a result of external activity,
                including, but not limited to, security attacks or fraud, we reserve the right to take reasonably
                appropriate measures, including, but not limited to, investigation and reporting, as well as
                notification to and cooperation with law enforcement authorities. In the event of a data breach, we will
                make reasonable efforts to notify affected individuals if we believe that there is a reasonable risk of
                harm to the user as a result of the breach or if notice is otherwise required by law. When we do, we
                will post a notice on the Website.

                <br><br>

                <h3>Changes and amendments</h3>
                <br>

                We reserve the right to modify this Policy or its terms relating to the Website and Services from time
                to time in our discretion and will notify you of any material changes to the way in which we treat
                Personal Information. When we do, we will revise the updated date at the bottom of this page. We may
                also provide notice to you in other ways in our discretion, such as through contact information you have
                provided. Any updated version of this Policy will be effective immediately upon the posting of the
                revised Policy unless otherwise specified. Your continued use of the Website and Services after the
                effective date of the revised Policy (or such other act specified at that time) will constitute your
                consent to those changes. However, we will not, without your consent, use your Personal Information in a
                manner materially different than what was stated at the time your Personal Information was collected.
                <br><br>

                <h3>Acceptance of this policy</h3>
