        </div>



        <div class="privacy">

            <p>
                These terms and conditions ("Agreement") set forth the general terms and conditions of your use of the
                <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://roofruler.com/">roofruler.com</a> website ("Website" or
                "Service") and any of its related products and services (collectively, "Services"). This Agreement is
                legally binding between you ("User", "you" or "your") and this Website operator ("Operator", "we", "us"
                or "our"). By accessing and using the Website and Services, you acknowledge that you have read,
                understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. If you are entering into this
                Agreement on behalf of a business or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to
                bind such entity to this Agreement, in which case the terms "User", "you" or "your" shall refer to such
                entity. If you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with the terms of this Agreement, you
                must not accept this Agreement and may not access and use the Website and Services. You acknowledge that
                this Agreement is a contract between you and the Operator, even though it is electronic and is not
                physically signed by you, and it governs your use of the Website and Services.

                <br><br>

                <h3>Accounts and membership</h3>


                You must be at least 18 years of age to use the Website and Services. By using the Website and Services
                and by agreeing to this Agreement you warrant and represent that you are at least 18 years of age. If
                you create an account on the Website, you are responsible for maintaining the security of your account
                and you are fully responsible for all activities that occur under the account and any other actions
                taken in connection with it. We may, but have no obligation to, monitor and review new accounts before
                you may sign in and start using the Services. Providing false contact information of any kind may result
                in the termination of your account. You must immediately notify us of any unauthorized uses of your
                account or any other breaches of security. We will not be liable for any acts or omissions by you,
                including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions. We may suspend,
                disable, or delete your account (or any part thereof) if we determine that you have violated any
                provision of this Agreement or that your conduct or content would tend to damage our reputation and
                goodwill. If we delete your account for the foregoing reasons, you may not re-register for our Services.
                We may block your email address and Internet protocol address to prevent further registration.

                <br><br>

                <h3>Billing and payments</h3>



                You shall pay all fees or charges to your account in accordance with the fees, charges, and billing
                terms in effect at the time a fee or charge is due and payable. Where Services are offered on a free
                trial basis, payment may be required after the free trial period ends, and not when you enter your
                billing details (which may be required prior to the commencement of the free trial period). If
                auto-renewal is enabled for the Services you have subscribed for, you will be charged automatically in
                accordance with the term you selected. Sensitive and private data exchange happens over a SSL secured
                communication channel and is encrypted and protected with digital signatures, and the Website and
                Services are also in compliance with PCI vulnerability standards in order to create as secure of an
                environment as possible for Users. Scans for malware are performed on a regular basis for additional
                security and protection. If, in our judgment, your purchase constitutes a high-risk transaction, we will
                require you to provide us with a copy of your valid government-issued photo identification, and possibly
                a copy of a recent bank statement for the credit or debit card used for the purchase. We reserve the
                right to change products and product pricing at any time. We also reserve the right to refuse any order
                you place with us. We may, in our sole discretion, limit or cancel quantities purchased per person, per
                household or per order. These restrictions may include orders placed by or under the same customer
                account, the same credit card, and/or orders that use the same billing and/or shipping address. In the
                event that we make a change to or cancel an order, we may attempt to notify you by contacting the e-mail
                and/or billing address/phone number provided at the time the order was made.

                <br><br>

                <h3>Accuracy of information</h3>


                Occasionally there may be information on the Website that contains typographical errors, inaccuracies or
                omissions that may relate to product descriptions, pricing, availability, promotions and offers. We
                reserve the right to correct any errors, inaccuracies or omissions, and to change or update information
                or cancel orders if any information on the Website or Services is inaccurate at any time without prior
                notice (including after you have submitted your order). We undertake no obligation to update, amend or
                clarify information on the Website including, without limitation, pricing information, except as
                required by law. No specified update or refresh date applied on the Website should be taken to indicate
                that all information on the Website or Services has been modified or updated.

                irrevocably waive any claim against the Operator with respect to such other services. The Operator is

                security processes or other policies of such other services. You may be required to register for or log
                into such other services on their respective platforms. By enabling any other services, you are

                "Intellectual Property Rights" means all present and future rights conferred by statute, common law or

                <h3>Limitation of liability</h3>


                To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will the Operator, its affiliates,
                directors, officers, employees, agents, suppliers or licensors be liable to any person for any indirect,
                incidental, special, punitive, cover or consequential damages (including, without limitation, damages
                for lost profits, revenue, sales, goodwill, use of content, impact on business, business interruption,
                loss of anticipated savings, loss of business opportunity) however caused, under any theory of
                liability, including, without limitation, contract, tort, warranty, breach of statutory duty, negligence
                or otherwise, even if the liable party has been advised as to the possibility of such damages or could
                have foreseen such damages. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the aggregate liability
                of the Operator and its affiliates, officers, employees, agents, suppliers and licensors relating to the
                services will be limited to an amount greater of one dollar or any amounts actually paid in cash by you
                to the Operator for the prior one month period prior to the first event or occurrence giving rise to
                such liability. The limitations and exclusions also apply if this remedy does not fully compensate you
                for any losses or fails of its essential purpose.

                <br><br>

                <h3>Indemnification</h3>


                You agree to indemnify and hold the Operator and its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents,

                reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred in connection with or arising from any third party allegations,
                claims, actions, disputes, or demands asserted against any of them as a result of or relating to your
                Content, your use of the Website and Services or any willful misconduct on your part.

                <br><br>

                All rights and restrictions contained in this Agreement may be exercised and shall be applicable and
                binding only to the extent that they do not violate any applicable laws and are intended to be limited
                to the extent necessary so that they will not render this Agreement illegal, invalid or unenforceable.
                If any provision or portion of any provision of this Agreement shall be held to be illegal, invalid or
                unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, it is the intention of the parties that the
                remaining provisions or portions thereof shall constitute their agreement with respect to the subject
                matter hereof, and all such remaining provisions or portions thereof shall remain in full force and
                effect.

                <br><br>

                shall be governed by the substantive and procedural laws of Alberta, Canada without regard to its rules
                on conflicts or choice of law and, to the extent applicable, the laws of Canada. The exclusive
